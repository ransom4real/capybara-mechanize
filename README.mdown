Capybara-mechanize
==================

This gems makes it possible to use Capybara for (partially) remote testing. It inherits most functionality from the RackTest driver and only uses [Mechanize](http://github.com/tenderlove/mechanize) for remote requests. 

It is currently in use to test the integration between a Rails application and Twitter authorization and sharing.

This gem is a [Capybara](http://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) extension. I have been inspired by the Capybara driver and some earlier efforts for a Mechanize driver.

Thanks to [Pinkelstar](http://www.pinkelstar.com) for giving me the time and the need to develop this gem.

### Installation

    gem install capybara-mechanize

### Usage without Cucumber

    require 'capybara/mechanize'

### Usage with Cucumber and tags

A @mechanize tag is added to your hooks when you add the following line to your env.rb

    require 'capybara/mechanize/cucumber'

The following scenario will then be using the Mechanize driver

    @mechanize
    Scenario: do something remote
      When I click the remote link
      
### Remote testing

When you want to use this driver to test a remote application. You have to set the app_host:

    Capybara.app_host = "http://www.yourapp.com"
    
Note that I haven't tested this case for my self yet. The Capybara tests pass for this situation though so it should work! Please provide me with feedback if it doesn't.

### Mechanize using proxy

If you are behind a proxy, you can specify an PROXY=ON ENV variable on the command line and setup mechanize to use proxy or not as below:

	Capybara.register_driver :mechanize do |app|
  		Capybara.app_host = "http://www.yourapp.com"
  		if ENV['PROXY'] == 'ON'
  			Capybara::Mechanize::Driver.new(app,{:proxy =>"http://yourproxy.com"})
  		else
  			Capybara::Mechanize::Driver.new(app)
  		end
	end
	
## Running tests

Until this library is merged with capybara there needs to be local app and you need to add the following to your host file:

    127.0.0.1 capybara-testapp.heroku.com 

Run bundler

    bundle install

Run the app with the following line: 

    bundle exec ruby -rrubygems lib/capybara/spec/extended_test_app.rb

Then you are ready to run the test like so

    rake spec

Todo
----
* Make the last 12 failing remote session spec pass, see remote_mechanize_spec and uncomment one line there to see them fail
* Test this driver with non-rack/non-ruby projects

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
-----------------------------
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
